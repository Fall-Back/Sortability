Sortability
===========
HTML lists - sortable

As with Filterability, this is a bit of a departure for a Fall-Back repo. I may decide to move this elsewhere.

The point of this tool is to allow a list of ordinary HTML 'items' to be sortable without having to use a large framework or library.

The HTML can be static or or come from a server. It doesn't matter. You just need to be able to include the script on the page and add the necessary attributes to your HTML.

The idea is that users will get a static list if the JS fails, but it will become sortable if it doesn't.

Note that you don't have to use a semantic list (ul/ol) - it works with any list-like structure.
